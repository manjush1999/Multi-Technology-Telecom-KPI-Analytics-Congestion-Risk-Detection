# Multi-Technology-Telecom-KPI-Analytics-Congestion-Risk-Detection
I built a telecom KPI analytics system analyzing 4G/5G performance using PRB utilization, throughput, accessibility, and radio KPIs. I created a congestion detection model using logistic regression and ranked high-risk sites. The dashboard helps identify congestion risk and performance gaps for proactive optimization

Business Problem
Telecom operators must monitor 4G/5G network KPIs to:
	• Detect congestion early
	• Reduce call drops
	• Improve throughput
	• Optimize capacity
	• Improve user experience
You will build a data-driven KPI monitoring & congestion detection system.

KPIs Used (Real Telecom KPIs)
Accessibility
	• RRC Success Rate
	• ERAB Setup Success
Retainability
	• Drop Call Rate
	• Session Drop Rate
Mobility
	• Handover Success Rate
Quality
	• DL Throughput
	• UL Throughput
	• Latency
Capacity
	• PRB Utilization %
	• Active Users
Radio
	• RSRP
	• SINR
